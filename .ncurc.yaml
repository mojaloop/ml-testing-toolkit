  # TODO: Upgrading ws is causing some incompatibility issues connecting to sdk-scheme-adapter ws server and causing some test failures
  "ws",
  # TODO: Upgrading axios is breaking lot of unit tests. It might be because of breaking changes in axios.

  # Upgrading `npm-check-updates` introduces rimraf>glob as a dependency that is under the BlueOak-1.0.0 licensing
  # which is still being investigated if it aligns with Mojaloop's policies.
  # An override is also in place for npm-check-updates>rimraf in package.json.
  # If you have trouble with package-lock.json not containing the override
  # delete BOTH node_modules/ and package-lock.json. Might be due to
  # https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4232
  # This is a temporary fix until Mojaloop decides on Blue Oak licensing.
