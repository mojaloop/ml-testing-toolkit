# Users Guide

## _Mojaloop Testing Toolkit_

### Introduction

The intention of this document is to provide a basic user guide to the **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**. This easy to use toolkit was designed for both technical and non-technical users, even though the primarily users would likely be Quality Assurance (QA) resources. By following this guide, users will have a better understand of the capabilities and functionality of the toolkit.

The **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** was designed for participants that would like to participate in the Mojaloop scheme. Intentionally build as a standard integration testing tool between a _Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP)_ and the _Mojaloop Switch_ (Hub), to facilitate testing. This tool set can potentially be used by both the DFSP and the _Mojaloop Switch_ to verify the integration between the 2 entities.

For additional back ground information on the Self Testing Toolkit, please see [Mojaloop Testing Toolkit](/documents/Mojaloop-Testing-Toolkit.md). It would be to the particpant's benefit to familiarise themselves with the understanding of the  [Architecture Diagram](/documents/Mojaloop-Testing-Toolkit.md#7-architecture) that explains the various components and related flows.
