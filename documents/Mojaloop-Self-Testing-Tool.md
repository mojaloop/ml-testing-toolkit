## 1. Introduction

As part of the Mojaloop Partner Development Project (PDP), a ‘self-testing tool kit’ for Mojaloop API implementations was requested by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to be delivered. This will happen in two stages, a Proof of Concept (PoC) delivered in the first stage and then a complete tool as the second stage that builds on the PoC. This will be delivered as a toolkit in the Mojaloop Open Source space.

### 1.1 Goal

The goal of the Self-testing Tool Kit is for the participants in a Mojaloop Hub, in particular DFSPs, but in future System Integrators and other entities, to have a standard way to test integration to a Mojaloop Hub. 

It should be simple to use for both technical and non-technical users; although it is primarily directed at QA personnel and testers, not all have the technical knowledge to be able to use the development and technical tools.

Having said that, it is understood that due to the time and resource limits, the Proof of Concept will concentrate on delivering the actual testing and automation ability; the functionality of the tool to be used by the less technical users, i.e. development of the front-end user interfaces, will be the next phase of the project.

The tool will make use of already existing standard components existing in the Mojaloop space such as Simulators and Labs, with the notable difference that it must have the capability of testing different versions of Mojaloop APIs.

### 1.2 Scope

The following characteristics are identified for the  initial version of Self-testing tool kit:

#### 1.2.1 Schema Validation

The tool must have the capability of testing the API’s structural characteristics, regardless of API version and implementation / local modifications.

To enable that, the tool must be able to:

- Read the current API definition being used, and based on that
- Check the incoming message according to that specific definition, and 
- Send the outgoing message according to that specific definition

Example of that would be:

- API versioning
- TIPS extension fields used to carry additional information
- ID fields allocated centrally (incoming message sent blank, and returned with ID) - [@dorota needs discussion]

#### 1.2.3 Content Validation

The tool must have the capability of testing the allowable and not-allowable content of the API calls.

This could be covered for example by a generic processor and a configuration file set according to the schema as tested in point (1) above.

The configuration file must be editable by the user, using a specified tool that does not require a high level of technical knowledge (currently JRE is being used).

#### 1.2.3 Workflow check

The tool must have the capability of testing the flow of specific API calls, where the outcome of the one call needs to be used by the following call. A typical example is a quote and transfer flow.

For PoC, only the Peer-to-Peer use case will be supported. Other use cases will be added in once the PoC is approved.

The testing of each use case must include:

- Golden Path testing
- Testing of error conditions as defined by a variable error code matrix

Certificate and Public Key integration? - as mentioned by Michael

### 1.3 Out of Scope

The scope is limited to endpoints / resources needed for the P2P use-case and once the PoC is in place, all the resources in the FSPIOP API can be supported.

"Settlement API" and the "Operations / Admin API" are outside of scope of the PoC.

### 1.4 User Interface

User Interface will be in scope only after the PoC is delivered. 

User Interface will replace the technical tools currently used to run the tool (docker, postman).

It will enable the QA tester to:

- Run the tests 
  - Run all the tests 
  - Run selected tests
- View test results
- Edit selected tests
- Add new tests
- Remove selected tests 

### 1.5 Audience

The tool is aimed for use initially by DFSPs only, but it will be later extended to be used by hubs, switches, system integrators and any other parties that will use Mojaloop API’s.

With the first phase of the tool, it will be delivered aimed at a technical user – that is, user that is able to run it using Postman. The follow-up phases will involve UI that will enable less technical users to use it as well.

## 2. Tool characteristics

Here’s the list of characteristics that we currently identified for the self-testing tool kit:
1. Version negotiation (using Accept, Content-Type headers) provided as per the API Definition v1.0 Section 3.3.4
2. Schema validation provided based on the specific version of the API (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
3. Validation of incoming requests based on Rules, after the Schema validation
4. Generate dynamic callbacks based on incoming requests using Rules (with capability to generate values at field/object level and not hard-coded)
5. Roadmap:
   - Use toolkit to initiate test cases - in progress
   - Validate association of a transfer request with an existing quote (configurable to disable)
6. Standardization:
   - JWS validation and generation and support TLS (using SDK standard components)

### 2.1 API version

1. Validations are done using the swagger. 
2. The API version available should be identified from swagger.json. 
3. API version needs to be validated just on the first call per client per session, not on every call. 

### 2.2 Rules engine

Rule engine will be used to:
1. Facilitate the different versions of API
2. Facilitate specific requirements from a specified implementation site
3. Generate values dynamically for message included in callbacks

Rule engine will apply to both parties (payer and payee) and both DFSP and hub.

## 3. Getting started

When a new release is done, as part of the workflow, Release Notes are published listing all of the new and/or enhanced functionality implemented as part of the release. These notes are used by the QA team to extend and enhance the existing Postman Collections where tests are written behind the request/response scripts to test both positive as well as negative scenarios against the intended behaviour. These tests are then run in the following manner:
- Manually to determine if the tests cover all aspects and angles of the functionality, positive to assert intended behaviour and negative tests to determine if the correct alternate flows work as intended when something unexpected goes wrong
- Scheduled - as part of the Regression regime, to do exactly the same as the manual intent, but fully automated (with the Newman Package) with reports and logs produced to highlight any unintended behaviour and to also warn where known behaviour changed from a previous run.

In order to facilitate the automated and scheduled testing of a Postman Collection, there are various methods one can follow and the one implemented for Mojaloop use is explained further down in this document.

There is a complete repository containing all of the scripts, setup procedures and anything required in order to set up an automated QA and Regression Testing Framework. This framework allows one to target any Postman Collection, specifying your intended Environment to execute against, as well as a comma-separated list of intended email recipients to receive the generated report. This framework is in daily use by Mojaloop and exists on an EC2 instance on AWS, hosting the required components like Node, Docker, Email Server and Newman, as well as various Bash Scripts and Templates for use by the framework to automatically run the intended collections every day. Using this guide will allow anyone to set up their own Framework.

**Postman Collections**

There are a number of Postman collections in use throughout the different processes:
- **OSS-New-Deployment-FSP-Setup:** This collection needs to be executed once after a new deployment, normally by the Release Manager, to seed the Database with the required enumerations and static data, as well as test FSPs with their accounts and position data in order to be able to execute any manual or automation tests by other collections.
  - Notes: Ensure that there is a delay of 200ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.
- **OSS-API-Tests:** This suite of tests will issue a request/response against each and every exposed API, testing APIs such as the Mojaloop core APIs, bulk quotes, admin-APIs, Settlement APIs, Metrics APIs, Fund-in and out APIs etc. These tests are done to test the message headers, body, responses received and not to test the end-to-end flow of a transfer for example
  - Notes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.
- **OSS-Feature-Tests:** Scenario based testing are performed with this collection, such as Settlements processes, Block Transfers, Negative testing scenarios and so on
  - Notes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.
- **Golden_Path:** This test collection is the one used by the scheduled regression testing framework to test end-to-end scenarios, resembling real-world use-cases where the response from one API call is used to populate the request of a subsequent call. We make use of an intelligent simulator playing the role of an FSP on the recipient side of the scenario, responding to various request from a Payer FSP as an example
  - Notes: Ensure that there is a delay of 1500ms if executed through Postman UI Test Runner. This will ensure that tests have enough time to validate requests against the simulator.

**Environment Configuration**

Import the Environment Config and make the required changes to reflect the correct endpoints to the Mojaloop deployment required to be tested. This environment file contains all the required variables and placeholders needed by all the collections, but the examples for endpoints provided, point to a local Mojaloop installation with the standard Ingress exposed local endpoints:
