Mojaloop Testing Toolkit
=============================

The goal of the Self-testing Tool Kit is for the participants in a Mojaloop Hub, in particular DFSPs, but in future System Integrators and other entities, to have a standard way to test integration to a Mojaloop Hub. 

It should be simple to use for both technical and non-technical users; although it is primarily directed at QA personnel. The goal is to ensure that the tool is easy to use for almost anyone involved with a Mojaloop related system be able to quickly configure the tool and use it.


## Quick Start

For getting started with **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit** quickly please follow the below steps.

The following software should be installed on your system to run the toolkit.

* Git
* Docker

Please execute the following lines to build and run the tool. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mojaloop/ml-testing-toolkit
cd ml-testing-toolkit
docker-compose up
```

You can get the web interface on http://localhost:6060/

The server will start and listen on port **5000**. You can send the mojaloop api requests to this port number.


## Testing With Mojaloop Simulator

If you want to test the tool for the whole functionality like schema validation, additional validation and callback generation ..etc, you can initiate a transfer cycle from mojaloop simulator UI.

Please follow the below steps from the ml-testing-toolkit folder

```bash
cd simulator
docker-compose up
```

The above command will start the services scheme-adapter, mojaloop-simulator and mojaloop-simulator-ui.

Open the following URLs in your browser and send a transfer from simulator and observe the toolkit logs in web frontend.

* http://localhost:6060 (Front end for **Mojaloop Testing Toolkit**)
* http://localhost (Front end for **Mojaloop Simulator**)


## Other Installation Guides

For exploring different ways of installation procedures, please follow this [Installation Guide](/documents/User-Guide-Installation.md)

## Usage Guides

After installation you can interact with the testing toolkit from either web interface or with a command line tool.

For Web interface follow this [Usage Guide](/documents/User-Guide.md)

For Command line tool follow this [CLI User Guide](/documents/User-Guide-CLI.md)


**If you have your own DFSP implementation you can point the peer endpoint to *Mojaloop Testing Toolkit* on port 5000 and try to send requests from your implementation instead of using mojaloop-simulator.**
