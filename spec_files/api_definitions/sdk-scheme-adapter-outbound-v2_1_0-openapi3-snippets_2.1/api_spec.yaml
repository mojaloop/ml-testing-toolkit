    Specification for the Mojaloop SDK Scheme Adapter Outbound Transfers API


    This API can be used by DFSP backends to simplify the process of sending
    funds to other parties within a Mojaloop scheme.


    Please see other documentation on
    https://github.com/mojaloop/sdk-scheme-adapter for more information.

        The HTTP request `POST /requestToPayTransfer` is used to request the
        movement of funds from payer DFSP to payee DFSP.

        The underlying Mojaloop API has three stages for money transfer:

          1. Quotation. This facilitates the exchange of fee information and the construction of a cryptographic "contract" between payee and payer DFSPs before funds are transferred.
          2. Authorization. This facilitates getting OTP from payee DFSP.
          3. Transfer. The enactment of the previously agreed "contract"

        This method has several modes of operation.

        - If the configuration variable `AUTO_ACCEPT_QUOTES` is set to `"false"`
        this method will terminate and return the quotation when it has been
        received from the payee DFSP.
          If the payee wished to proceed with the otp, then a subsequent `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` request (accepting the quote) is required to continue the operation.
          The scheme adapter will then proceed with the transfer state.

        - If the configuration variable `AUTO_ACCEPT_OTP` is set to `"false"`
        this method will terminate and return the otp when it has been received
        from the payee DFSP.
          If the payer wished to proceed with the transfer, then a subsequent `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` request (accepting the quote) is required to continue the operation.
          The scheme adapter will then proceed with the transfer state.

        If the configuration variables `AUTO_ACCEPT_PARTIES` and
        `AUTO_ACCEPT_QUOTES` are both set to `"true"` this method will block
        until all three transfer stages are complete. Upon completion it will
        return the entire set of transfer details received during the operation.


        Combinations of settings for `AUTO_ACCEPT...` configuration variables
        allow the scheme adapter user to decide which mode of operation best
        suits their use cases. i.e. the scheme adapter can be configured to
        "break" the three stage transfer at these points in order to execute
        backend logic such as party verification, quoted fees assessments etc...

      description: >-
        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.

        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a
        participant. The MSISDN identifier should be in international format
        according to the [ITU-T E.164
        standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en). Optionally, the
        MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
        international prefix.

        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a participant. The format of
        the email should be according to the informational [RFC
        3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a
        participant. Examples of personal identification are passport number,
        birth certificate number, and national registration number. The
        identifier number is added in the PartyIdentifier element. The personal
        identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company) is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier
        can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific
        username or bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element
        should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For
        referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
        use the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any
        format, as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
        characters and should be entered without whitespace.

        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should
        be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system. The ALIAS
        identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined by the PartyIdentifier.

        The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular
        expression to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.


        Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the Name
        type is "^(?!\s*$)[\w .,'-]{1,128}$". The restriction does not allow a
        string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode characters are
        allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe (‘), dash (-), comma (,)
        and space characters ( ).


        **Note:** In some programming languages, Unicode support must be
        specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used, the flag
        UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.

        In a normal scenario, electronic funds are transferred from a Consumer’s

        Consumer) transaction.

        - PAYMENT - Usually used for performing a transaction from a Consumer to
        a Merchant or Organization, but could also be for a B2B (Business to
        Business) payment. The transaction could be online for a purchase in an
        Internet store, in a physical store where both the Consumer and Business
        User are present, a bill payment, a donation, and so on.

        - REFUND - Used for performing a refund of transaction.
